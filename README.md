# OpenImpact
### Motivation
To easily enable calculation and comparison of the ecological impacts of consumer choices.
### Principles
* Openness: sources and assumptions are transparently presented to the user
* Specificity: ultimately, any variable that significantly affects a thing's impact should be tweakable
* Objectivity: as much as possible, these models must not be influenced by personal biases
* Correctness: any and all issues found regarding these models' assumptions or data should be brought to light and promptly fixed
### Caveats
I am neither a professional programmer nor an expert in the science of climate change or ecology. As such, I recognize that there will be technical and conceptual errors in these models and I welcome corrections. This project simply came about throught a personal desire for an easy and centralized way to calculate impacts of my own future consumer decisions.
